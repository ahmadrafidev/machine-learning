   - Linear Regression
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Naive Bayes
   - Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
3. **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms**
   - K-Means Clustering
   - Hierarchical Clustering
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
4. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
   - Q-Learning
   - Deep Reinforcement Learning
5. **Feature Engineering**
   - Feature Scaling
   - Handling Missing Data
   - Feature Selection Techniques
6. **Model Evaluation**
